# FPGA_Handwritten_digit_recognition

This repository presents an implementation of a fully connected Neural Network used for the recognition of handwritten digit. <br>
The neural network consists of :
* An average pooling layer
* A first dense layer of 32 neurons
* An output layer of 10 neurons
<br>
<br>
The input vector consists of the flatten 28 by 28 image (ie a 784 elements vector). <br>
The output of the neural network is the handwritten digit.
